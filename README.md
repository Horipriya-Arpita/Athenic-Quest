# Athenic-Quest

A  collection of brain games. You can [install](Setup_AthenicQuest/Release/Setup_AthenicQuest.msi) it in your windows pc.
 
## Goals and Details

To build a collection of logic-based puzzles that demands the application of logical thinking process and algorithmic reasoning and thus improves analytical intuition beneficial for budding programmers.

This project aims to motivate the players to use logical reasoning and analytical thinking process and make an intuitive foundation helpful for entering the spectrum of computational logistics in a fun, engaging way. However, anyone with a liking for problem solving can enjoy this collection of games and puzzles. To conclude, this is an enjoyable way to facilitate our pastimes. 

<h3><em>In this project, the logic-based puzzles and games presented before the user are classified into 3 categories. <br><br>
1. Algebraic Category <br>
2. Combinatorial Category <br>
3. Graph Theory-based Category</em> <br><br>

<strong>Main menu contains the individual 6 games. </strong></h3>
